Devlaptop Lab Design:
    RHEL 8.6, since that's handy.
    1 server/mother (master and worker) + 2 agent/child (worker) nodes. I am planning to add additional nodes (mother and child) in the future to have HA.
    Keepalived cluster between K3S nodes.
    Calico instead of Flannel (K3S default) as CNI.
    Nginx Ingress instead of Traefik (K3S default) Ingress.
    Etcd instead of SQLite (K3S default).
    A VM with RHEL 8.6 as Rancher cluster manager to have a nice management UI.
    MetalLB instead of servicelb.
    Longhorn as local distrubuted block storage as CSI.
    Automatic SSL certificate management and renewals with cert-manager.

Home Lab Design:
    Void Linux.
    3 server/mother (master and worker) + 9 agent/child (worker) nodes. (3x4)
